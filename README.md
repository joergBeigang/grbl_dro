# grbl_dro
a man in the middle approach for a DRO including a rotary jog control for GRBL

It runs on an Arduino Mega 2560. Should run on any Arduino board with at least two hardware serials.
As a display four 7 segment 8 digit LED displays driven by a max72XX are used. They are nice and bright
and very cheap.
